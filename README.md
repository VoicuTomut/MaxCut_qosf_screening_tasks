# MaxCut_qosf_screening_tasks
 


## Task 4 
"The MaxCut problem is a well-known optimization problem in which the nodes of a given undirected graph have to be divided in two sets (often referred as the set of “white” and “black” nodes) such that the number of edges connecting a white node with a black node are maximized. The MaxCut problem is a problem on which the QAOA algorithm has proved to be useful (for an explanation of the QAOA algorithm you can read this blogpost)."


## Motivation 
MaxCut problem is a problem thet is use as a proof of concept for  showcase  the  abiliy of quantum algorithms. In the past I approatch to solve these problem but using other thenic called Full Quantum Eigensolver (FQE) [ ] .  I know that MaxCut problem can be solved using Grover and  Variation Quantum Eigansolver (VQE) is also a solution for these problem. 
I saw these task as a good oportunity to recap all these algorithms and make a compartion between them.
